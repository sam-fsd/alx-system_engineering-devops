# Incident Postmortem

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** The outage occurred on [Date and Time (with timezone)] and lasted for [Duration].
- **Impact:** The Apache server hosting the WordPress website experienced a 500 Internal Server Error. During this period, users attempting to access the website encountered slow performance or complete unavailability. Approximately [Percentage]% of users were affected.
- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the issue was identified as a typographical error in the file `/var/www/html/wp-settings.php`. Specifically, a file with an incorrect PHP extension, 'phpp,' was being accessed instead of the intended 'php' extension.

## Timeline

- **Detection Time:** The issue was detected on [Date and Time] through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in HTTP 500 error responses.
- **Detection Method:** Monitoring systems generated alerts based on increased HTTP 500 errors. This triggered an immediate investigation by the operations team.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Operations began by checking the server logs and quickly identified the high occurrence of 500 errors.
  - Assumptions were made that the errors might be due to misconfigurations, server overload, or potential security incidents.
  - The investigation focused on analyzing server metrics, inspecting Apache configurations, and examining WordPress-related logs.

### Misleading Paths

- Initially, the team suspected a potential DDoS attack due to the sudden spike in errors. However, further analysis revealed a more subtle issue.
- A brief examination of the WordPress database was conducted, suspecting corrupted data or a plugin issue, but this did not yield relevant information.

- **Escalation:** The incident was escalated to the development team when the operations team identified the issue as code-related. Developers with expertise in PHP and WordPress were involved to expedite the resolution.
- **Resolution:**
  - Upon closer examination of the `wp-settings.php` file, a typo was discovered in a file inclusion statement, where the extension was incorrectly specified as 'phpp' instead of 'php.'
  - The typo was corrected, and the Apache server was gracefully restarted to apply the changes.
  - Subsequent monitoring showed a significant reduction in HTTP 500 errors, confirming the resolution.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** The root cause was traced to a typographical error in the file path specified in `wp-settings.php`. This led to the server attempting to execute a file with an incorrect PHP extension ('phpp').
- **Resolution:** The issue was resolved by correcting the typo in the file path, ensuring that the correct PHP file was referenced. A graceful server restart was performed to apply the changes without disrupting active user sessions.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements:**
  - Regular code reviews and static code analysis tools could be implemented to catch syntax errors and typos during the development phase.
  - Enhanced monitoring for specific HTTP error codes could be set up to quickly identify and respond to similar issues.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Immediate Actions:**
    - Conduct a thorough review of all PHP file references in the WordPress codebase to identify and correct any potential typos.
    - Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time alerts for critical HTTP error codes.
  - **Long-term Actions:**
    - Implement automated testing processes to catch syntax errors and typos during the development and deployment pipeline.
    - Schedule regular code audits to ensure the integrity of critical configuration files.
    - Provide training or awareness sessions for developers to emphasize the importance of code quality and typo prevention.
